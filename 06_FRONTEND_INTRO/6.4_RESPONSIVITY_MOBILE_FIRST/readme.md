## 6.4 - Responsivity: Mobile First

### What was covered here?

With the constant growth of smartphone devices being used for - almost - everything, the "Mobile First" concept becomes almost mandatory.

It defines that every web page should be designed first thinking of how it should look on a small screen (max-width: 450px or so), to then scale up after every mobile styling has been applied. As such, it was proposed to alter an existing page layout in order to account for mobile devices. Details of the exercise can be found [here](./exercise).
