## 6.3 - DISPLAY: FLEX

### What was covered here?

CSS display:flex is, aligned with display:grid one of the most important updates to CSS. With these two display options a whole new level of possibilities opened up for web-design, increasing the complexity of possible designes while not increasing the complexity of code required to reproduce said designs.

On this topic every container and child level property was covered. I recommend checking [this](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)

#### Comments

Because of how important CSS is, i've been using it regularly on every project i create. So every page hosted on this repository probably has some of it. It's a global concept, so i won't upload any specific exercise on this topic, given every page here is a use-case of flexbox.

As always, any feedback or suggestion is welcomed.
