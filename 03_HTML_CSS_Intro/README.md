## Module 03 - HTML, CSS
This repository holds whats been done during Trybe's 3rd module: An intro to HTML & CSS.

The main focus here was to create my projects page, which is hosted at:
https://fabiosenracorrea.github.io/

That site and it's repository is where i used most of the content learned here.
