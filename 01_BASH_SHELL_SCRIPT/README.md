## Module 01 - Bash & Shell Script

This repository holds whats been done during Trybe's 1st module: an intro to Bash & Shell Script

### What was covered here?

This module covers the basics of using and understanding a unix system. Here i've learned how to navigate and modify instances and how to create instances of personalized rotines (shell scripts).

Here you can find most of the scripts i've written using this module's lectures.
