# 00 - COURSE CERTIFICATES

Given the length and amount of content this course has, Trybe divided it in 4 'main modules', that together lasts for the entire year of the course.

After successfully completing each main module, the student is awarded a certificate of his knowledge on that specific area. After obtaining all the certificates with sufficient grade on each and every module, the final completion module certificate is given.

This student is proud to say that the overall grade obtained on the entire course was **100%**. Every single project scored perfectly and was delivered within it's deadline.

> *Note: as of july 15, 2021, time of this commit, the completion certificate was still being processed by Trybe. The estimated time is within the next 2-3 weeks. As soon as it's ready it will be posted here.*
