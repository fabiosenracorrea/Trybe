*Note: current solution solves the challenge, but it is __slow__. A different approach will be attempted soon.*

In an array, arr, the elements at indices i and j (where i < j>) form an inversion if arr[i] > arr[j]. In other words, inverted elements arr[i] and arr[j] are considered to be "out of order". To correct an inversion, we can swap adjacent elements.

Given an array arr, return the number of inversions to sort the array.
