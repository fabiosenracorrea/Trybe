#### Comments

Mastering JavaScript is a task each and every web developer should acomplish in order to excel in the field. Because of that, starting on this module, i've been solving programming challenges at [Code Wars](https://www.codewars.com/) and trying to climb in on ranks while learning and improving my programming skills.

Every challenge i solve is uploaded [here](https://github.com/fabiosenracorrea/Trybe/tree/master/04_JAVASCRIPT_INTRO/code_wars)

Each file is named after the challenge, added with the respective level. (Be aware: the difficulties go from 8 (easiest) to 1.)
