# Handling Login State with Redux

This application was developed in a pair programming exercise as described [here](../).

It has 4 pages:

- Home
- Login
- Dashboard
- Register Clients

The idea here was to understand the use of Redux on a more 'real' app.

We used Redux to control registered clients and login state on the dashboard.

It's simple, style-free. Play close attention to the redux folder. There's where the gold is ;)
