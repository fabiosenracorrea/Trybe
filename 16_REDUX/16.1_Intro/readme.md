#### Comments

Redux does an awesome job controlling our application state. But in order to excel with it, you need to understand it's key concepts and constraints deeply. That involves using it WITHOUT React first. And that may seem obvious, since it can be used with Angular and many others, but it's association with React is so strong (at least before the Context API), that's worth mentioning, just to be sure.
