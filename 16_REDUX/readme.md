#### Comments

Redux is surely an awesome tool and it helps quite a lot with big applications that have lots of states that are needed elsewhere. Creating a prop-drilling problem for yourself is no longer an issue when connecting it with React.

Despite being so popular on the market right now, there's a lot of opinions that say it won't last much longer, specially considering the launch of React's Context API.

Even if the context-API has arrived to probably take it's spot on the show, there's still a lot of apps linked with Redux, and knowing how the whole structure works can be the deciding factor between you and another developer.
