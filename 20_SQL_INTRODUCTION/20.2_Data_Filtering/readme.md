## 20.2 - DATA FILTERING

Now that we've seen the basics of a SQL QUERY and how it's done, it's time to get more specific!

And that's **where** the fun starts. (pun intended)

Here we've seen:

* Basic math operators (=, >=, >, <>, <, =<)
* Basic logic operators (AND, OR, NOT, XOR)
* Range operators (IN, BETWEEN)
* Match operator (LIKE and %LIKE% and _LIKE)
* DATE specifications (DATE & DATETIME data types) and how they match with the above operators

#### Exercises

Because of how widely spread SQL exercises are, we have a couple from different sources here. You can check them out below:

* [Exercise 1](./exercises/exercise1.md)
* [Exercise 2](./exercises/exercise2.md)

#### Comments

Following on basic SQL commands, there's not much to specify here. Only that you should know all these commands by heart.

###### Feedback

As always, any feedback or suggestion is welcomed.
