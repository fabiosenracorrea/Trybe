## Module 14 - Agile Development

This directory covers Trybe's 14th module.

## What was covered here?

We step off the 'hard skill content lane' for a module to learn more about Agile Development!

- TBA!!

Because this whole module references team work, the only 'hard skill' we cover is a Project to develop the front end of an online store *in a group of 4 students*. You can check it out:

#### Comments

As your application grows, it becomes clearer that organization and procedures for team work are completely necessary. How'd you organize your team to work on 4 different features at the same time, starting from the same project? How'd that day-to-day basis be?

This is exactly why we need to adopt an Agile Development mindset. (Quick note: obviously this is not the only methodology that solves this and other issues, but it's recognized as one of the best to at the very least, know about nowadays.)

###### Feedback

As always, any feedback or suggestion is welcomed.
