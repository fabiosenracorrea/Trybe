#### Comments

As mentioned before, SQL is a vital part of any company today. It's near impossible to have a career in software development and do not come across a single SQL query or problem to solve. Because of that, knowing the basics of queries doesn't suffice, and we need to tackle on more advanced ways of both transforming and extracting data from our databases.

And to do so, it's certain you will need knowledge on everything that's covered on this module.
