## Module 11 - React Intro

This directory covers Trybe's 11th module.

## What was covered here?

Starting to go deeper into the front-end section of the course, we'll dive into the React world, dividing it's content into a few different modules. On the first React-Module, 11, we cover the basics of creating a React app using `create-react-app` and how to abstract info using *components*

To get started on this whole new world, this module was divided into:

* [Hello, React](./11.1_Hello_World)
* [Components](./11.2_Components)
* [Project 01 - Movie Cards Library (1/3)](./Project_01_Movie_Library)

To check each part of the module, simply click on the desired link above.

#### Comments

React is one of the most popular front-end frameworks on today's standards. The ability of constructing SPAs (Single Page Applications) that work smoothly and controlling so many different variables and states (spoiler!) without it seem almost impossible after getting in contact with the 'World of React'.

On the next couple of Modules/Projects there will be a lot of new content to cover and better understand all of it's features. It's pretty exiting!

###### Feedback

As always, any feedback or suggestion is welcomed.
