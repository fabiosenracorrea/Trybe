# JSON WEB TOKEN Exercise

The exercise here was to refactor one of the applications developed [here](../../../../27_NODEJS_SOFTWARE_ARCHITECTURE_REST_RESTFULL/27.1_ARCHITECTURE_MODEL/exercises/).

As a note, this application doesnt have **services**, so the logic is all inside the controllers. The focus here is authentication with JWT.
