#### Comments

User authentication with JWT is standard nowadays, so understanding how to deal with them is pretty mandatory. File uploads are also required in a lot of applications, even if it's just a profile pic handler. Using multer can suffice to get the file uploaded by the user temporally, but it's recommended to use some sort of **Cloud** storage for your deployed application. One of the best choices and my got to option would be [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)
