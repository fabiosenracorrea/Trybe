#### Comments

The main focus here was to create my [projects page](https://fabiosenracorrea.github.io/), which will be updated regularly and since it requires a specific repository to work properly, you can check it's repo [here](https://github.com/fabiosenracorrea/fabiosenracorrea.github.io)

2 other pages were also created trying to apply most of the knowledge aquired on my own.
