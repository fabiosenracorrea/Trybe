#### Comments

RESTful apis are increasingly better over the years, as more and more different devices appear to consume it's information. As of today, if you want to integrate the data your user sees on it's web/mobile access, designing a RESTful api will make your job a lot easier to connect those different clients.

The best pattern, i'd say, is creating an api that returns JSON, which is understood by any programming language and can be easily transformed into on-screen elements by whichever client receives it.
