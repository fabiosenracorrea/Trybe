#### Comments

Working on a team is a big part of software development. Even if you are the sole developer in charge of a task, it's likely that you'll need to know how to communicate your progress, difficulties along the way and ideas that might pop up during development. Because of that, training on an environment like that should be really beneficial to you.

It's awesome that there's so much more than code to a software developer career, and practicing it is also very important.
