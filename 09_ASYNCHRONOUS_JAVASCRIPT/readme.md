## Module 09 - Asynchronous Javascript: Callbacks & Promises

This directory covers Trybe's 9th module.

## What was covered here?

This module's goal is to introduce the concept os Promises and asynchronous code in Javascript, an important part of the daily routine on pretty much any application nowadays. There are a lot of code that actually takes more time to execute, and it's return is crucial for the rest of some logic. Such as:

* Database queries
* API calls

To better understand this concept, this module was divided into:

* [Callback & Promises](./9.1_Callback_Promises)
* [Project 01 - Shopping Cart](./Project_01_Shopping_Cart)

#### Comments

Working with async. codes is part of daily routine for a web-developer. Making API calls, handling data storage insertions/deletions/queries and so much more involve directly adapting your code to account for that.

Understanding where to use (and why) Promises and asynchronous calls is a huge deal breaker when it comes to building a working application.

As always, any feedback or suggestion is welcomed.
