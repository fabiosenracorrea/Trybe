#### Comments

In today's standards, mastering how to create and adapt to existing layouts, as well as understanding why each design/logic was chosen to be implemented is crucial to becoming a better developer. The concepts covered here are all fundamentally necessary at ANY project, and should not propose any 'threat' to whoever has to handle with them.

###### Feedback

As always, any feedback or suggestion is welcomed.
