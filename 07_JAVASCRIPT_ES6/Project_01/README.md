## Project 01 - Unitary Tests

The first project of Trybe's 7th module, centered around designing functions and assertion tests to create 'functional functions', or, in other words, functions that do exactly what's proposed, with a way of knowing if that assumption becomes false after any code change.

### What was proposed here

As a literal copy/paste of the instructions:

## Requisitos do projeto

### 1 - Implemente a função do arquivo `src/average.js`

### 2 - Implemente os casos de teste no arquivo `tests/numbers.spec.js`

### 3 - Implemente a função do arquivo `src/vqv.js`

### 4 - Implemente os casos de teste no arquivo `tests/circle.spec.js`

### 5 - Implemente a função do arquivo `src/createStudent.js`

### 6 - Implemente os casos de teste no arquivo `tests/productDetails.spec.js`

### 7 - Implemente a função do arquivo `src/objCalculator.js`

### 8 - Implemente a função do arquivo `src/myCounter.js`

**Agora prepare-se! Esse último requisito vai te guiar através de um longo e rico processo de desenvolvimento orientado a testes (Test Driven Development, ou TDD). Dará trabalho, mas vale a pena!**

### 9 - Implemente os casos de teste no arquivo `tests/restaurant.spec.js` e as funções do arquivo `src/restaurant.js`

#### Comments

In the 'real world', every project already in distribution should be constantly tested, in order to guarantee that everything is working as designed. There's multiples ways of doing these tests, be it at a 'higher level', such as whole application tests, be it at 'lower level', such as unitary tests. IN almost every single case, unitary tests should be the choice, considering they each test for a specific method/functionality of your project, it's much easier to pin-point exactly what's breaking. If we take into account the cost of running a test for the entire application against hundreds (or even thousands) of unitary tests, it becomes clear what should be implemented.

This project was a very interesting was of understanding how a function should be designed and properly tested, in order to prevent unknown bugs.
