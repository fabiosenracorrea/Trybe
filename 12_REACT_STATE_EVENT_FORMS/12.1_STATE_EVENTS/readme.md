## 12.1 React State & Events

### What was covered here?

Thinking quickly to a Javascript-based HTML page, how would you, for instance, save the numbers of clicks a user gave to a button? Well, using React, we do this using **state**. State is a group of values that are important in some sort to our component, and that we may (or may not) alter during execution. But be aware! They can only be altering using the special **setState** method/function, to keep React's immutability principle.

### Exercises on this lesson

On this lesson, the exercise was to apply state/event handling on React to our previously written *Pokedex* application. This was previously done, and you can check out the results [here](../../11_REACT_INTRO/11.2_Components/my-pokedex).

#### Comments

Building a web-page that can handle user interaction is mandatory for most pages. As such, mastering State and Event Handling using *React based logic* is really powerful. It's not the only option, as you can obviously still use `getElementById` and similar pure-JS techniques and have relative success with it. But the whole purpose when using React is being able to use it's features to boost the application performance.
