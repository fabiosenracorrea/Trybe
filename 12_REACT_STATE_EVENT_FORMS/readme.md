## Module 12 - React States, Events and Forms.

This directory covers Trybe's 12th module.

## What was covered here?

After understanding the basics of a react application and structure, it's time to learn how we can interact and respond to user interaction, saving necessary info on application memory and altering said information as needed.

And here something has to be made clear: React's concept of **immutability**. We can't alter our component's state directly or change any *props* passed on to it on execution time. The only way to alter a state is using the *setState* function, be it on the class or function syntax.

On this short module, we cover:

* [State & Events on React](./12.1_STATE_EVENTS)
* [Form Events](./12.2_FORMS)
* [Project 01 - Movie Cards Library (2/3)](./Project_01_Movie_Library)

#### Comments

After learning how to build *static* pages using React, it was time to understand how we can build components that react dynamically with user input/interaction. With these concepts mastered, a React application can advance to the next level and start to "feel more real" with it.

###### Feedback

As always, any feedback or suggestion is welcomed.
