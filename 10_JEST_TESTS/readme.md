## Module 10 - JEST Testing

This directory covers Trybe's 10th module.

## What was covered here?

Unitary testing is something that saves you a lot of time and money. As such, it should be widely used on every application. On this course, it was something already covered on an earlier module, when **assert** was studied ([here](../07_JAVASCRIPT_ES6/7.3_Test_Assertions)). But as complexity grows, the need of a more robust way of testing our code increases drastically. To account for that, we can add a *test framework* to our workflow.

And one of the most incredible frameworks on this matter is [Jest](https://jestjs.io/en/), Facebook's open source project.

To get started on this whole new world, this module was divided into:

* [Basic Synchronous Tests](./10.12_Basic_and_Async_Tests)
* [Asynchronous Tests](./10.12_Basic_and_Async_Tests)
* [Function Mocking](./10.3_Mock_Functions)
* [Project 01 - Practicing Everything!](./Project_01_Jest_Testing)

#### Comments

JEST is one of the most popular frameworks out there. As such, understanding how to use it to better test and error-proof an application is a skill any webDev should look for, especially considering how much of an improvements Jest is compared to the basic *assert* lib.
