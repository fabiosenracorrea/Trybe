## Module 08 - Higher Order Functions and other ES6+ features

This directory covers Trybe's 8th module.

## What was covered here?

Continuing from last module, this module covers some major improvements JS has got since ES6. This time, we focus our attentions on powerful array methods, but also cover new syntax that came to make our lives easier and dealing with objects and arrays.

* [For Each, Find, Some, Every & Sort methods](./8.1_forEach_find_some_every_sort)
* [Map & Filter](./8.2_map_filter)
* [Reduce](./8.3_reduce)
* [Rest/Spread, Destructuring, Short Syntax](./8.4_rest_spread_and_more)
