## Module 08 - Higher Order Functions and other ES6+ features

This directory covers Trybe's 8th module.

## What was covered here?

Continuing from last module, this module covers some major improvements JS has got since ES6. This time, we focus our attentions on powerful array methods, but also cover new syntax that came to make our lives easier and dealing with objects and arrays.

* [For Each, Find, Some, Every & Sort methods](./8.1_forEach_find_some_every_sort)
* [Map & Filter](./8.2_map_filter)
* [Reduce](./8.3_reduce)
* [Rest/Spread, Destructuring, Short Syntax](./8.4_rest_spread_and_more)
* [Project 01 - Zoo Functions](./Project_01)

#### Comments

Javascript pre/post ES6+ are completely different worlds. The 'post' modifications brought the language to a high level state, opening a lot of possibilities and expanding the 'js scope'.

Understanding how to use these features really takes your code level to the next level.
