## Module 13 - React Component Lifecycle & Routing.

This directory covers Trybe's 13th module.

## What was covered here?

Following our complete React overview, it's time to cover how exactly a component is built and altered, and how we can use this knowledge to better accommodate our function calls on the right place. After that, we check out a vital part of a React application: **Routing**. With that, we'll be able to build Single Page Applications (SPAs)!

* [Component Lifecycle](./13.1_COMPONENT_LIFECYCLE)
* [Routing](./13.2_ROUTING)
* [Project 01 - Movie Cards Library (3/3)](./Project_01_CRUD_Movie_Cards)

#### Comments

Better understanding how exactly a component behaves is crucial when optimizing applications to the maximum. Learning where to call your functions (i.e. an API call) can drastically improve the performance we all dream of.

And to top it off, we finally understand how to build SPAs with a little help from the `react-router-dom` lib. The complexity of the projects are about to explode!
