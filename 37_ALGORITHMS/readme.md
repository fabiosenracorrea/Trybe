#### Comments

After you get comfortable with a programming language and most of it's common powers, something else starts to matter, as your applications grow: performance. There's probably dozens of ways of achieving the same end-result with a given language, but that doesn't mean all of the are correct to be implemented.

On this module we uncover a little more about *code performance*
